## Tasks Completed âœ…

###1. Data Quality Assessment

- I checked for and addressed **duplicates** and found none.
- I identified and flagged:
  - **197 rows** with anomalous discounts
  - **0** with invalid quantity
  - **42 rows** with invalid costs
- I verified that no missing critical values were dropped unnecessarily
- I identified missing or null values for Country, Category, Region, and mapped them to fill up the missing data

### 2. Sales, Revenue, and Discount Rates by Region and Segment
- I created a **Segment** column by splitting the 'Category' column
- I grouped the data by **Region** and **Segment**to compute the total **Sales** and Average **Discount** per grouping

**Insights**: Scotland has the highest total sales, followed by East Midlands and London, while Wales has the lowest Total Sales

### 4. Product Categories with Highest Margins

When computing the highest margin, I noticed Total_Margin was negative for all categories, which means the business might have sold at a loss, or the cost price of the data is off

The product with the highest Margin is **Food - Dressing**

**Output:** 
Top Category by Total Margin:
Category          Food - Dressing
Total_Margin               -3.571
Average_Margin          -1.190333
Total_Sales                  7.17

**Result**:
**Online Sales**: 51.6%
**In-store Sales**: 48.4%

## Visualizations

1. **Bar Plot**: Total Sales by Region
   Insight: East Midlands leads with Total Sales by Region
2. **Pie Chart**: Sales Distribution-Online vs In-Store
   Insight: Most products were sold online.
3. **Bar Charts**:
